//Salting is used to encrypt passwords. A salt is a random value that is added to the password before it is hashed. 
//The salt is stored in the database along with the hashed password.
//When a user logs in, the salt is retrieved from the database and added to the password before it is hashed.   
//The salt is used to verify the password.

//The salt is a random value that is generated when the user creates an account.
Ex:- abc= abc%?@# //salt
     password= abc123
     abc%?@#abc123  //salt+password
